Ergonomic dependency handling.

Dependencies are the functions that represent resources and effects needed by the application that are  outside if its the control: from network requests and file system access all the way down to random number generators and the measurement of time.

Dependency Injection, Dependency Mocking, and other patterns and frameworks are all designed to avoid the problems that application dependencies cause for testing: reliability and performance both suffer.

This crate attempts make dependency handling easy; encouraging it use.
